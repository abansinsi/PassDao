# The PASS Distributed Application

The source includes a forum website and smart contracts with ABI to read from or write into the Blockchain using generic Ethereum applications (https://github.com/ethereum/mist, https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts ...).

## The forum (http://forum.passdao.org/)

Used to discuss the prospective projects and proposals before submitting to the Blockchain. Works on a Linux server with Discourse (cf http://www.discourse.org/). A user field "PublicKey" allows linking the forum users with one of their Ethereum adresses for instance for giveaway programs of DAO shares. Links in the header of the forum allows accessing to the smart contracts of the Dapp.

## DAO and Project Smart Contracts
ABI DAO: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassDao  
ABI Projects: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassProject  
  
Used for the management and display ("DappScan") of the upgrades and projects from the beginning of the application. One Pass DAO smart contract, a meta project (concerns the Pass DAO project as a whole and not a specific project) and a project smart contract for each project.

## Committee Room Smart Contract
ABI: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassCommitteeRoom  
  
Used to submit proposals, vote and execute the decisions made by the Community of shareholders.  
  
Public functions are :

#### Create Contractor: 
Allows creating a project manager or a contractor smart contract before submitting contractor proposals to Pass DAO. Inputs: the contractor creator smart contract (you can use a verified: 0xf03262DCE825ACd93d0630d3e6aE495B7d907890, ABI: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassContractorCreator), the recipient for the withdrawal from the smart contract, the project (meta project if no specific project, the name and a description of the project if new project). Note: for new projects, the contractor will be the project manager of the created project.

#### Contractor Proposal: 
Proposal to order a work from a project manager or a contractor or/and to fund the Dao. For project managers, PASS tokens are created to raise funds. Otherwise, the contractor is paid from the Dao balance (if not enough, shares are created to raise funds). Inputs: the amount of the proposal in wei, the address of the contractor smart contract (0 if proposal to fund Pass DAO), the proposal (the index of the proposal in the contractor smart contract or: a description and a hash of the proposal document), the funding rules (not mandatory), the debating period (not mandatory). Note: 10 eth minimum have to be sent to make a proposal. This amount will be given back in Dao shares after the voting period if more than 10% of the Community supported the proposal.

#### Resolution Proposal: 
Submit a question to a vote by the Community of shareholders. Inputs: the name of the question, a description, the address of the project, the debating period (not mandatory). Note: 10 eth minimum have to be sent to make a proposal. This amount will be given back in Dao shares after the voting period if more than 10% of the Community supported the proposal.

#### Rules Proposal: 
Proposal to change the rules of the committee room. Inputs: the min quorum for proposals, the minimum amount in wei of committee fees, the percentage of positive votes to reward shares to the creator of the proposal, the period before committees, the minimum debate period, the inflation rate for the rewarding of fees to voters, the token price inflation rate for project manager proposals and the default funding period. Note: 10 eth minimum have to be sent to make a proposal. This amount will be given back in Dao shares after the voting period if more than 10% of the Community supported the proposal.

#### Upgrade Proposal: 
Proposal to upgrade the Committee Room or the manager smart contracts. Inputs: the new Committee Room smart contract (not mandatory), the new share manager smart contract (not mandatory) or the new token manager smart contract (not mandatory). Note: 10 eth minimum have to be sent to make a proposal. This amount will be given back in Dao shares after the voting period if more than 10% of the Community supported the proposal.

#### Vote (for shareholders): 
Support or vote against a proposal. Inputs: the index of the committee, true if support and false against.

#### Execute decision: 
After and according to the votes of a committee. Input: the index of the committee.

#### Order a work from a contractor: 
After the closing time of the funding for the proposal. Input: the index of the contractor proposal.

## Manager Smart Contracts
ABI: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassManager  
  
Used for the management of tokens. Includes the PASS token Manager smart contract. One smart contract for the DAO shares and one smart contract for the PASS tokens. The smart contracts are conform to ERC20. Public functions are : 

#### Buy tokens for a proposal: 
Allows to buy tokens in order to fund the Dao according to an approved proposal. Inputs : the index of the proposal and the address of the buyer (default: msg.sender).

#### Withdraw pending amounts: 
Allows receiving tokens or refunding after the closing time of the fundings.

#### Buy Tokens: 
Allows sending a buy order to the Blockchain.

#### Remove orders: 
Allow removing buy orders from the Blockchain and refunding. Input: from an order to another order (default: all orders).

#### Sell Tokens: 
Allows selling tokens from the buy orders. Inputs: the amount in token you want to sell, from an order to another order (default: all orders).

## Contractor Smart Contracts
ABI: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassContractor  
  
Created by a contractor creator smart contract (you can use a verified: 0xf03262DCE825ACd93d0630d3e6aE495B7d907890, ABI: https://github.com/pacifics/Dao/blob/master/ABI/ABI%20PassContractorCreator) and used by the project managers and contractors of the application. One smart contract for each project manager or contractor.  
  
Public functions are : 

#### Update Project Description
Allows the project manager to update the project Description and the hash of the project document.

#### Update recipient
Allows the contractor to update the address of the recipient for the withdrawals from the contract.

#### Withdraw:
Allows the contractors using their smart contract as an account manager with deposits (fallback function) and withdrawals.

#### New proposal: 
Payments to the contractors are done with ethers and step by step. For each step, the shareholders decide by voting to continue or to stop ordering the work described in the contractor proposal. Inputs: the creator of the proposal (default: msg.sender), the maximum amount in wei, a description and a hash of the proposal document.

## Notes

- This Dapp is for Ethereum Blockchain (ETH) only and is not foreseen to run on "Ethereum Classic" Blockchain (ETC).

- During the development phase of projects, Pass DAO will not collect and share any revenue from his contractors. On the other side, in case of success of the promoted services, the price of shares and tokens (which will be sold to customers when launching a service) should raise.

- The creators of proposals have to pay committee fees. If the proposal is estimated (and not necessarily approved), the creator of the proposal receives shares with an amount equal to the minimum committee fees.

- The shareholders should vote on contractor proposals as it's the only way to receive committee fees. 

- By allowing fundings step by step and by limiting the funding amounts, we limit the amount of money "at risk" and avoid useless blocked ethers in the Dao.

- The creation of new shares is decided by the shareholders and can be limited using a moderator smart contract.
